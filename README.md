# MLxE Architecture for Reinforcement Learing

MLxE Architecture is a highly efficient, multiprocessing based implementation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that maximizes the utilization of the available to you hardware recourses. It achieves 2x efficiency improvement relative to Threading based implementations in the test environment.

It is intended for RL learning and research applications with focus on ease of understanding and of modifying underlying RL algorithms (A3C, Rainbow, SAC,...) thus it is implemented in linear fashion with limited use of python programmatical overhead (Classes, Functions,...).
